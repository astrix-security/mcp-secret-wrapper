Securely inject secrets from vault systems into MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers without exposing credentials in configuration files.

## Usage

Convert any MCP Server configured for your client and uses a static secret in 2 simple steps:

1. Add the secret to one of the [supported vaults](#support)
2. Replace the server's settings in the configuration file to use MCP Secret Wrapper:
    * Run MCP Secret Wrapper with `npx`
    * Pass any environment variables that should be inject. Their value is the secret location
    * Place the separator (`--`) followed by the previous command and all its arguments
    * Add the required `VAULT_TYPE` environment variable and any additional optional environment variables

### Example Usage - GitHub MCP with AWS Secret Manager

**Before: Config Environment Variable (‚ùå Insecure - Hardcoded Secret)**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "notionApi": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args":
      [
          "run",
          "-i",
          "--rm",
          "-e",
          "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN",
          "ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server"
      ],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "github_pat_EXAMPLE"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**After: Using Vault (‚úÖ No Exposed Secret)**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "notionApi": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "git+https://github.com/astrix-security/mcp-secret-wrapper",
        "--vault-type=aws",
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:123456789012:secret:example-ABCDE",
        "--",
        "docker",
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "-e",
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN",
        "ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server"
      ],
      "env":
      {
        "VAULT_TYPE": "aws",
        "VAULT_PROFILE": "aws-profile",
        "VAULT_REGION": "us-east-1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Support

| Vault Type | Status | Description |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| AWS Secrets Manager | ‚úÖ Supported | Full support for AWS Secrets Manager with IAM authentication |
| HashiCorp Vault | üöß In-Progress | Support for HashiCorp Vault |
| Azure Key Vault | üöß In-Progress | Support for Azure Key Vault |
| Google Secret Manager | üöß In-Progress | Support for Google Secret Manager |

## Why?

MCP servers are becoming the backbone of AI agent infrastructure, but most implementations lead to severe risk by exposing hardcoded credentials. Our analysis of 5,000+ MCP server implementations revealed that **over 50% use static, hardcoded API keys and secrets** in their configuration files.

### The Problem
- **Exposed Credentials**: API keys, tokens, and secrets stored in plain text
- **No Rotation**: Static credentials that never expire or rotate
- **Access Control**: No fine-grained access control
- **Compliance**: Violates security best practices and compliance requirements

### The Solution
MCP Secret Wrapper provides:
- **Dynamic Secret Retrieval**: Secrets are fetched at runtime from secure vaults
- **No Hardcoded Secerts**: No secrets are present on the local machine
- **Multi-Vault Support**: Works with AWS, HashiCorp, Azure, and Google vaults
